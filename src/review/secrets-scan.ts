// SELF-CONTAINED NATIVE PORT (reviewbot→loopover convergence): byte-faithful to the reviewbot source
// (src/core/secrets-scan.ts); there are no stricter-tsconfig deltas — the module is already total. No

// #4608: the format-specific patterns + placeholder-value heuristics are shared with
// content-lane/security-scan.ts via ./secret-patterns (both live under src/, same build, same deploy — no
// deploy-independence reason to hand-duplicate them; that duplication already caused two independent,
// currently-live drifts, see #4587/#4604). review-enrichment/src/analyzers/secret-scan.ts (REES) stays a
// genuinely separate, deliberately wider copy — not imported here — because REES deploys standalone on
// Railway with its own tsconfig/build/test pipeline; the same reasoning this file used to document for
// itself before the #4608 extraction. See ./secret-patterns's header and
// scripts/check-engine-parity.ts's SECRET_DETECTION_TWIN_PAIR for how REES's copy is kept from drifting.
