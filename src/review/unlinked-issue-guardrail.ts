// Orchestrator for the unlinked-issue guardrail (#unlinked-issue-guardrail, credibility-gate-farming
// defense). Combines the config gate, the cheap deterministic pre-filter (src/signals/unlinked-issue-
// candidates.ts), and the AI precision check (./unlinked-issue-match.ts) into a single per-PR decision: does
// this PR's diff appear to directly solve an EXISTING open issue it never linked? A FIRST confirmed match
// HOLDS the PR for manual review (never auto-closes, never auto-merges past it) -- see src/settings/
// agent-actions.ts's `unlinkedIssueMatchHold`. A CONFIRMED REPEAT by the SAME contributor (tracked via the
// existing `audit_events` ledger -- the same general-purpose actor/event-type ledger already used for the
// review-nag cooldown and decision-pack debounce, `hasRecentAuditEvent`/`recordAuditEvent` in
// db/repositories.ts) escalates to an actual CLOSE (`unlinkedIssueMatchClose`), since a second occurrence is
// no longer a coincidence worth a human's benefit of the doubt.
//
// Cost-bounded by construction: every short-circuit below runs BEFORE the DB read or any AI call, so a
// repo that hasn't opted in (the default) or a PR that already links an issue (the common case) pays
// nothing beyond two boolean checks.
