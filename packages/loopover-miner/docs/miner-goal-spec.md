# MinerGoalSpec (`.loopover-miner.yml`)

> Also published on the docs website: [MinerGoalSpec](https://loopover.ai/docs/ams-goal-spec)

Per-repo configuration telling an autonomous LoopOver miner what to look for and how to behave when targeting a repo. Parsed by `@loopover/engine` (`parseMinerGoalSpec` / `parseMinerGoalSpecContent`); this document is the field reference. Machine-readable shape: [`../schema/miner-goal-spec.schema.json`](../schema/miner-goal-spec.schema.json). Copy [`.loopover-miner.yml.example`](../../../.loopover-miner.yml.example) to `.loopover-miner.yml` and edit.

Discovery order (first match wins):

- `.loopover-miner.yml`
- `.github/loopover-miner.yml`
- `.loopover-miner.json`
- `.github/loopover-miner.json`

Every field is optional. Unknown keys are ignored; a malformed field falls back to its documented default with a warning — a broken file never hard-fails the miner.

## Relationship to `.loopover.yml`

| File | Actor | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `.loopover.yml` | Review stack | How a maintainer's repo **reviews** incoming PRs (focus manifest, gate, scoring knobs). |
| `.loopover-miner.yml` | Miner runtime | How a miner **searches for and prioritizes** work in a target repo. Unrelated naming concern — not affected by the review-config rebrand above. |

They are read by different components and do not conflict. A miner should still treat a target repo's public `.loopover.yml` `wantedPaths` / `blockedPaths` as a hard floor when both files exist.

## Fields

### `minerEnabled` (boolean, default: `true`)

Explicit opt-out: a public repo with no file remains minable. Set `false` to halt all miner targeting.

### `wantedPaths` (string list, default: `[]`)

Work areas the maintainer wants a miner to focus on. Glob list. Empty means no preference.

### `blockedPaths` (string list, default: `[]`)

Paths off-limits to a miner; candidates touching one should be skipped. Glob list. Mirrors `.loopover.yml` `blockedPaths` semantics.

### `preferredLabels` (string list, default: `[]`)

Issue labels a miner should favor. Empty means no preference.

### `blockedLabels` (string list, default: `[]`)

Issue labels a miner must skip.

### `maxConcurrentClaims` (integer `>= 1`, default: `1`)

Maximum issues one miner may hold claimed on this repo at once.

### `issueDiscoveryPolicy` (`encouraged` | `neutral` | `discouraged`, default: `neutral`)

How strongly this repo encourages a miner to open discovery issues.

### `feasibilityGate` (object, default: `{ enabled: true, suppressedReasons: [] }`)

Per-repo tuning for the feasibility gate (`buildFeasibilityVerdict`) a miner consults before starting work. This is config-parsing surface only — a caller wiring the gate into a decision flow is responsible for reading and applying this policy.

- `enabled` (boolean, default: `true`) — whether the feasibility gate is consulted at all before a miner starts work.
- `suppressedReasons` (string list, default: `[]`) — specific avoid/raise reason codes (e.g. `duplicate_cluster_high`) this repo wants ignored.

### `selfPlagiarism` (object, default: `{ similarityThreshold: 0.85 }`)

Per-repo tuning for the Governor self-plagiarism throttle consulted before `open_pr` (#2345). Compares a prospective PR's diff fingerprint against the miner's own recent submission history.

- `similarityThreshold` (number in `[0, 1]`, default: `0.85`) — Jaccard similarity at/above which two fingerprints read as near-duplicates across repos.

### `killSwitch` (object, default: `{ paused: false }`)

Per-repo kill-switch consulted by the Governor chokepoint before every write action (#2341). Distinct from `minerEnabled`: `minerEnabled` is a discovery-time opt-out (a miner never even considers the repo), while `killSwitch.paused` is a runtime halt of an already-in-flight queue — un-pausing resumes exactly where the queue left off. A separate, operator-controlled GLOBAL kill-switch (env var `LOOPOVER_MINER_KILL_SWITCH`) halts every repo at once and always wins over this per-repo flag.

- `paused` (boolean, default: `false`) — halts all miner WRITE actions for this repo without deregistering it from targeting/discovery.

### `execution` (object, default: `{ liveModeOptIn: null }`)

Per-repo dry-run/live execution opt-in consulted by the Governor chokepoint (#2342). A freshly-configured miner always defaults to dry-run (observe/log only, never execute a write) — this field is the only per-repo path to live mode, and it alone is not sufficient: the miner's own operator must also separately opt in globally (env var `LOOPOVER_MINER_LIVE_MODE=live`) before writes actually execute. A repo that wants to guarantee it never receives live automated writes, regardless of any operator's global setting, should use `killSwitch.paused: true` instead — the kill-switch always takes precedence over any live-mode opt-in.

- `liveModeOptIn` (string or `null`, default: `null`) — must equal EXACTLY the literal `"live"` to opt in. Any other value (a typo, `"yes"`, `"on"`, or a boolean `true` from a malformed file) is treated as not opted in — deliberately not a boolean flag, so a fat-fingered config can never accidentally enable live writes.
