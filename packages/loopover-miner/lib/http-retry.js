// polling, sleeping an exponential backoff between attempts and giving up after `maxAttempts`. A 2xx/3xx/4xx
// response is returned immediately, and a THROWN error (a network-level failure) propagates unchanged rather than
// being retried — the pollers' existing failure-mode contract (#4281) deliberately bubbles those to the caller.
