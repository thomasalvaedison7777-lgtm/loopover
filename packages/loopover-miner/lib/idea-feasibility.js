/** Pre-execution feasibility check for a freeform Rent-a-Loop idea (#5671).
 *
 * Runs post-schema-validation and pre-compute-allocation on an idea submission (the intake shape defined in
 * #4779), so a customer can no longer burn paid or free-trial compute on an idea that was never going to
 * succeed. It is the freeform-text counterpart to the metadata `feasibility` CLI (`feasibility-cli.js`, #4270).
 *
 * REUSED from feasibility-cli.js AS-IS:
 *   - the engine's pure `buildFeasibilityVerdict` composer and its `avoid > raise > go` precedence — an idea
 *     inherits exactly the same verdict machinery a metadata-resolved issue does, so there is no second,
 *     divergent decision surface;
 *   - the injectable-verdict test seam (`options.buildFeasibilityVerdict`), matching the CLI's convention.
 *
 * NEW for freeform text (#5671, per the #4779 rubric):
 *   - `deriveIdeaIssueStatus`, which computes the `issueStatus` discriminant from the idea's OWN structure
 *     instead of a resolved GitHub issue. An idea with no objective success signal is `invalid` (impossible to
 *     evaluate objectively) and is rejected before compute; an unresolvable target repo is `missing` (out of the
 *     loop's scope) and is flagged.
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE (stays with #5136): judging abusive/illegal or semantically off-topic intent from prose — that is
 * a content-moderation policy call, not this deterministic structural gate.
