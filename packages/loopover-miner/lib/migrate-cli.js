// Proactive schema-migration runner for the miner's local SQLite stores (#4871). Every store already applies
// its own pending migrations (schema-version.js's applySchemaMigrations) as a side effect of being opened by
// whatever command happens to touch it first -- this command instead lets an operator PROACTIVELY bring every
// known store's EXISTING on-disk file up to date in one pass (e.g. right after upgrading, or before starting a
// fleet), without needing to guess which command happens to touch which store first. Mirrors status.js's
// storeIntegrityChecks [name, resolve*DbPath(env)] store list exactly (same seven stores `doctor` already
// covers), but actually OPENS each store (rather than a read-only integrity probe) so its real open/init
// function's migration path runs for real. A store file that does not exist yet is skipped, not created --
// "migrate" brings existing files up to date; it is not another way to bootstrap fresh state (that's `init`).
