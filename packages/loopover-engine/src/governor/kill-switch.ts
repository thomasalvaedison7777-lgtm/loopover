// Governor kill-switch (#2341): the emergency-halt primitive every write-adjacent governor decision consults
// FIRST, before any other calculator. Two independent triggers compose into one scope: a GLOBAL env-level
// switch that halts every repo at once, and a PER-REPO switch (from `.loopover-miner.yml`'s MinerGoalSpec
// `killSwitch.paused` field) that halts only its own repo's queue while leaving the rest of the fleet running.
// Mirrors `src/settings/agent-execution.ts`'s `isGlobalAgentPause` truthy-string idiom for the review-stack's
// own kill-switch (#776) — a parallel mechanism for the miner's own local runtime, not the same one.
//
// DETECTOR ONLY — no IO, no persistence. Composing this with the other pure calculators into one fail-closed
// allow/deny verdict (and recording every CHECK, not just a transition) is the Governor chokepoint's job
// (#2340), which consults this module first in its "safest wins" precedence.
