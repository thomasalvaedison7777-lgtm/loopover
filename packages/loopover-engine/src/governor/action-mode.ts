// Governor dry-run-by-default enforcement (#2342): resolves the miner's overall action mode -- "safest wins"
// precedence mirroring `resolveAgentActionMode` (`src/settings/agent-execution.ts`): paused > dry_run > live.
// A freshly-configured miner (no opt-in present anywhere) MUST default to dry_run, never live -- this is the
// deny-by-default floor `src/settings/autonomy.ts`'s `DEFAULT_AUTONOMY_LEVEL = "observe"` establishes for the
// review-stack, extended here to the miner's own runtime.
//
// DETECTOR ONLY -- no IO, no persistence. Consulting this alongside the other pure calculators (rate-limit,
// budget caps, reputation, self-plagiarism, non-convergence) and recording every CHECK is the Governor
// chokepoint's job (#2340), which consults this module (after the kill-switch) in its precedence ladder.

 *    means dry-run.

 * A target repo that wants to guarantee it never receives live automated writes -- even from an operator whose
 * own miner instance is globally live -- can omit its repo opt-in or set its OWN kill-switch (`killSwitch.paused:
 * true`, #2341), which takes precedence over any live-mode opt-in per step 1 above.
