// Governor self-reputation throttle (#2346, pure).
// Deterministic, side-effect-free cadence math for the local Governor. Given the miner's OWN recent terminal
// outcomes on one repo (merged vs. human-closed/gate-rejected) and a threshold config, it decides how much to
// slow that repo's submission cadence: a clean track record runs at full cadence, a rising unfavorable ratio
// degrades cadence toward a floor, and a recovering ratio restores it — never a hard permanent ban. It reads
// only the miner's own local history (never shared/cross-fleet data), computes numbers only, and does NOT store
// state or gate any write; that enforcement wiring is a separate, maintainer-owned chokepoint. The
// outcome-history-driven shape mirrors src/signals/reward-risk.ts, adapted to the miner's own local-only view.
