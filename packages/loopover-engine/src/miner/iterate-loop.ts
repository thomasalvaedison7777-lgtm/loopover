// Local create->score->self-review->decide iterate-loop orchestrator (#2333): the actual autonomous control
// flow Phase 3 exists to build. Repeatedly invokes a `CodingAgentDriver` (coding-agent-driver.ts), self-reviews
// the resulting diff against the byte-identical predicted-gate target (self-review-adapter.ts, #2334), and
// consults the pure policy (iterate-policy.ts, #2335) to decide -- autonomously, no human in the loop at this
// stage -- whether to keep iterating, hand off to Phase 4 submission, or abandon.
//
// TAGGED maintainer (not contributor) per the phase brief: this orchestration control flow is the precise
// chokepoint the fixed architecture skeleton's safety-tier system reserves for the owner -- it is the trigger
// surface for "does the system keep trying, or does it eventually open a PR" without a human approving each
// step, and is adjacent to the #1 slop-at-scale strategic risk (an autonomous fleet maximizing gate-pass rate
// can mass-produce gate-passing-but-low-value PRs).
//
// FAIL CLOSED ON AMBIGUITY: a driver run that does not complete successfully, or a self-review call that
// itself throws, is treated identically to a `SelfReviewOutcome` of `"ambiguous"` -- iterate-policy.ts's own
// precedence then abandons rather than optimistically continuing or handing off. The loop never fabricates a
// "pass" from anything other than a genuinely successful `runSelfReview` call.
//
// BOUNDED INSIDE THE LOOP: both the iteration ceiling (`input.maxIterations`) and the optional cumulative
// budget (`input.budget`, evaluated every iteration via attempt-metering.ts's `accumulateAttemptUsage`/
// `evaluateAttemptBudget` against real per-iteration turns/costUsd/wallClockMs/tokens, #5395/#5653) are
// enforced here every iteration -- not left to an external caller to remember, and not just capped after the
// fact between loop cycles (loop-cli.js's own governor cap usage). A `maxIterations <= 0` input abandons
// immediately, before ever invoking the driver.
//
// AUDITABLE: every iteration's decision (continue / handoff / abandon) is recorded via the injected
// `appendAttemptLogEvent` dependency (attempt-log.ts's normalized event shape) before this function returns
// control to its caller for that iteration -- the decision trail survives independently of this function's own
// return value. A logging failure never alters the loop's decision (mirrors the governor-ledger and
// pretooluse-hook append-failure handling elsewhere in this package).
