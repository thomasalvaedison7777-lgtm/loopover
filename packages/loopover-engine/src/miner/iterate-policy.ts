// Iterate-loop stop/abandon/handoff policy (#2335): the explicit POLICY the orchestration loop's control flow
// (#2333, sibling issue) consults each iteration to decide among exactly three outcomes. Deliberately split
// from the loop MECHANICS (#2333) so the actual thresholds/rules are one small, individually-reviewable, pure
// artifact -- `decideNextAction` needs no driver, no worktree, no IO to test.
//
// STRATEGIC CONSTRAINTS this policy encodes (loopover-miner-autonomy-roadmap):
//   - "never auto-submit (P4) before governor+caps (P5)" -- a mandatory clean predicted-gate PASS is the ONLY
//     path to `"handoff"`; an ambiguous or errored self-review downgrades to abandon, never optimistically
//     hands off.
//   - "disengage SILENTLY on rejection" (the Matplotlib "MJ Rathbun" cautionary tale) -- a rejection signal
//     wins over EVERYTHING else, including a self-review that would otherwise pass. Continuing to submit to a
//     repo that has already shown it does not want automated contributions is the exact anti-pattern this
//     guards against, regardless of how good any individual attempt looks.
//   - "reward MERGED net-positive (never submission volume)" -- the no-progress detector and the iteration/cost
//     ceilings exist so a stuck loop stops wasting turns (or spend) chasing a submission that was never going
//     to land, rather than grinding toward *a* submission for its own sake.
//
// AUTONOMY DIAL (wired in #6560): `IterationState.autonomyLevel` carries the operator's configured
// `AmsPolicySpec.selfLoopAutonomy` (#6559) and narrows step 3 of the ladder below -- the pass->handoff
// transition -- and nothing else. It never touches the iteration/cost ceilings or steps 1-2, and it is
// optional: an unset level is treated as `"auto"`, so a pre-#6560 `IterationState` decides exactly as before.
