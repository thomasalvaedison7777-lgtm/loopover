 * DETERMINISTICALLY, mirroring the pre-merge-checks title/description phrase-match pattern (review/pre-merge-checks.ts)
 * exactly: a case-insensitive substring match against already-resolved PR data, no AI judgment. Consent is
 * satisfied when EITHER configured method holds (an "either" contract, not "all", because a repo may only be able
 * to detect ONE method for a given PR — e.g. no check-run data was resolved): the PR body contains
 * `consentPhrase`, OR a check-run named `checkRunName` concluded `success`/`neutral`. When NEITHER method is
 * configured (both null), there is nothing to evaluate — no finding (byte-identical, matches `pre_merge_checks`'
 * empty-checks behavior).
 *
 * `checkRunConclusion` is `undefined` when the caller could not resolve check-run data at all (a transient
 * fetch failure, or the predicted-gate metadata-only path, which never sees live check-runs) — that is NOT the
 * same as a resolved-but-absent check-run (`null`, "no check-run with this name exists"). When check-run
 * detection is configured and its conclusion is unresolved (a transient fetch failure, or "not yet run"), this
 * HOLDS (`cla_check_unresolved`) instead of failing closed — exactly like an unresolved changed-file set HOLDS
 * a path-gated pre-merge check rather than silently skipping (auto-merge bypass) or hard-closing on a
 * transient miss. This applies EVEN WHEN `consentPhrase` is ALSO configured but not (yet) satisfied: per the
 * "either method holds ⇒ satisfied" contract above, an unresolved check-run might still satisfy consent, so
 * deciding purely from a not-yet-satisfied phrase would hard-fail a PR the check-run could have saved (#2564
 * gate-review finding). A hold only degrades to a hard `cla_consent_missing` once EVERY configured method has
 * been definitively resolved and none of them is satisfied. Pure + side-effect-free; the caller pushes the
 * finding into the advisory before the gate evaluates.
