# @loopover/miner

Foundation CLI for the local Gittensory miner runtime.

This package is the future home of the autonomous discover → analyze → plan → prepare → create → manage miner workflow. In this foundation phase it provides the package scaffold, a minimal CLI surface for `--help` and `--version`, and a non-blocking npm registry version nudge on startup.

## Status

Current scope is intentionally small:

- workspace package wiring
- CLI entry point
- `--help` and `version` commands
- startup npm version nudge (override with `--no-update-check` or `LOOPOVER_MINER_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`)

Environment variables read by the miner are documented in [`docs/env-reference.md`](docs/env-reference.md).
Regenerate that file with `npm run miner:env-reference` from the repo root after adding or removing env reads.

Config precedence (`.gittensory-miner.yml` vs operator env vs CLI flags) is documented in
[`docs/config-precedence.md`](docs/config-precedence.md).

A committed micro-benchmark for the discovery-ranking and local-store read/write paths lives at
[`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md) — run it with `npm run benchmark:miner` from the repo root.

Real miner commands land in follow-up issues.

The package also includes the first metadata-only discovery primitive: `fetchCandidateIssues` lists open issue
metadata across target repos, and `searchCandidateIssues` does the same from a GitHub issue-search query. Both
paths hard-skip repos whose `AI-USAGE.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` explicitly bans AI-generated PRs. They perform
GitHub GET requests only, never clone source, never upload source, and never write to GitHub.

The package also includes a metadata-only ranker: `rankCandidateIssues` composes deterministic engine signals
(potential, feasibility, lane fit, freshness, dup risk) and returns fan-out candidates sorted by `rankScore`.
It never clones source and never writes to GitHub.

Discovery is per-tenant, not github.com-specific (#4784): `lib/forge-config.js` (`resolveForgeConfig`) holds the
forge base URL, API version, request headers, repo path, search endpoint/qualifiers, user-agent, and credential env
var behind one resolver with gittensory's github.com values as the only defaults, so the fan-out targets another
forge unchanged. `gittensory-miner discover` surfaces `--api-base-url <url>` and `--token-env <VAR>` and forwards a
tenant goal spec to the ranker, printing `usedDefaultGoalSpec` so a fall-back to the built-in rubric is explicit
rather than silent. See [`docs/repo-agnostic-capability-audit.md`](docs/repo-agnostic-capability-audit.md) for the
#4780 audit this executes.

The package also includes repo stack auto-detection: `detectRepoStack` (`lib/stack-detection.js`) inspects an
already-cloned target repo's manifest / lockfile / config files and returns a structured description — language,
package manager, and the build / test / lint / format commands — for Node (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun), Python
(pip/poetry/pipenv/uv), Rust, Go, Maven, and Gradle. It is pure (injectable `existsSync` / `readFileSync`), never
throws, and per its acceptance criteria **fails closed** — a repo with no recognized manifest returns
`{ detected: false, reason }` and a command that can't be inferred without guessing stays `null`, rather than being
assumed. The attempt path consumes it: `buildCodingTaskSpec` appends the real stack summary (and any
confidently-inferred build/test/lint/format commands) to the coding-agent instructions so validation uses
the target repo's own tooling rather than assuming LoopOver/gittensory CI ([#4786](https://github.com/JSONbored/gittensory/issues/4786)). (#4785)

The package also includes an append-only governor decision ledger: `initGovernorLedger` / `appendGovernorEvent`
persist structured allow/deny/throttle/kill-switch outcomes in local SQLite for contributor audit. Insert-only —
no enforcement wiring yet. (#2328)

The package also includes a real, persisted governor pause/resume control surface: `gittensory-miner governor
pause [--reason <text>]` / `governor resume` / `governor status` toggle a `paused`/`reason`/`pausedAt` flag on
governor-state.js's existing scalar-state row, and `loop-cli.js`'s iteration loop checks it at the same two
boundaries as the kill switch (before the first cycle and at the top of every subsequent one) — pausing mid-run
stops the loop before its next cycle claims anything, and resuming (clear the flag, re-invoke `loop`) continues
from the already-persisted queue/run state exactly where it left off. Distinct from the read-only kill switch
(env/YAML inputs this package never writes) and the one-way run-halt breaker (no resume path at all) — this is
the first genuinely operator/governor-writable stop/go control; the autonomous logic that decides *when* to pause
is separate, later-wave scope. (#4851)

The package also includes a local soft-claim ledger: `openClaimLedger` / `claimIssue` / `releaseClaim` /
`listActiveClaims` persist which issues this miner instance has claimed on this machine. The table is local
bookkeeping only — duplicate winners are adjudicated elsewhere via `@loopover/engine`. (#2291)

The package also includes an append-only event ledger: `initEventLedger` / `appendEvent` / `readEvents` persist
immutable miner-loop events in local SQLite for contributor audit. Insert-only — rows are never updated or
deleted. (#2322)

The package also records local PR outcomes: `recordPrOutcomeSnapshot` / `readPrOutcomes` write and reduce the
miner's OWN record of the outcomes of its OWN PRs (merged / closed, with an optional rejection-reason bucket) over
the append-only event ledger above. This is DISTINCT from the gittensory server's `recordPrOutcome`
(`src/review/outcomes-wire.ts`), which writes hosted-backend audit rows from the GitHub App's webhook stream — same
concept name, different codebase layer, no shared code (a laptop-mode miner may have no webhook relay at all). (#4274)

The package also includes an append-only prediction ledger: `initPredictionLedger` / `appendPrediction` /
`readPredictions` persist each predicted-gate verdict (conclusion / pack / readiness score + blocker/warning
codes, plus the producing `ENGINE_VERSION`) in local SQLite, so a later self-improve pass can score predictions
against realized outcomes. Insert-only. (#4263)

The package also includes the Phase 7 calibration runner: `runHistoricalReplayCalibrationCycle`
(`lib/calibration-run.js`) scores a completed historical-replay run with the deterministic objective-anchor scorer,
folds the composite into the engine's `computePhase7CalibrationLoop` combine alongside the existing `pr_outcome`
signal, and persists the combined snapshot as a `calibration_snapshot` event — queryable with
`gittensory-miner ledger list --type calibration_snapshot` or `readCalibrationSnapshots` /
`latestCalibrationSnapshot`. It measures and records only; acting on the metric (autonomy bumps, threshold tuning)
stays maintainer-only. See [`docs/miner-selfimprove-calibration.md`](docs/miner-selfimprove-calibration.md). (#4248)

`gittensory-miner manage status` now also folds each tracked repo's current discover/plan/prepare run state
(`run-state.js`) alongside its managed PR rows into a "run portfolio" view — `collectRunPortfolio` /
`renderRunPortfolioTable` — so a repo actively being discovered or planned shows up even with zero PRs yet.
Additive only: the existing `rows` JSON key and PR table are unchanged; `runPortfolio` is a new key printed
after the existing table. A real GUI dashboard surface is out of scope here — `apps/gittensory-miner-ui/` is
Phase 6 of the same roadmap tracker and hasn't been scaffolded yet. (#4279)

## Local storage

Independent local SQLite stores back the commands above. Each keeps its own file, its own table(s), and (for most stores) its own env-var override — this is a DRY pass over their shared path-resolution/open boilerplate (`local-store.js`), not a merge into one database. (#4272)

See [`docs/env-reference.md`](docs/env-reference.md) for the full `LOOPOVER_MINER_*` / `MINER_*` env-var list.

| Store | File | Primary table(s) | Module | Env var override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Laptop bootstrap | `laptop-state.sqlite3` | `laptop_meta` | `laptop-init.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_CONFIG_DIR` (path only) |
| Run state | `run-state.sqlite3` | `miner_run_state` | `run-state.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_RUN_STATE_DB` |
| Claim ledger | `claim-ledger.sqlite3` | `miner_claims` | `claim-ledger.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_CLAIM_LEDGER_DB` |
| Portfolio queue | `portfolio-queue.sqlite3` | `miner_portfolio_queue` | `portfolio-queue.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_PORTFOLIO_QUEUE_DB` |
| Event ledger | `event-ledger.sqlite3` | `miner_event_ledger` | `event-ledger.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_EVENT_LEDGER_DB` |
| Plan store | `plan-store.sqlite3` | `miner_plans` | `plan-store.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_PLAN_STORE_DB` |
| Governor ledger | `governor-ledger.sqlite3` | `governor_events` | `governor-ledger.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_GOVERNOR_LEDGER_DB` |
| Governor state | `governor-state.sqlite3` | `governor_scalar_state`, `governor_reputation_history`, `governor_own_submissions` | `governor-state.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_GOVERNOR_STATE_DB` |
| Attempt log | `attempt-log.sqlite3` | `attempt_log_events` | `attempt-log.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_ATTEMPT_LOG_DB` |
| Prediction ledger | `prediction-ledger.sqlite3` | `predictions` | `prediction-ledger.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_PREDICTION_LEDGER_DB` |
| Replay snapshot | `replay-snapshot.sqlite3` | `replay_snapshots` | `replay-snapshot.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_REPLAY_SNAPSHOT_DB` |
| Deny-hook synthesis | `deny-hook-synthesis.sqlite3` | `deny_rule_proposals` | `deny-hook-synthesis.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_DENY_HOOK_SYNTHESIS_DB` |
| Worktree allocator | `worktree-allocator.sqlite3` | `worktree_slots` | `worktree-allocator.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_WORKTREE_ALLOCATOR_DB` |
| Orb export | `orb-export.sqlite3` | `orb_export_meta` | `orb-export.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_ORB_EXPORT_DB` |
| Policy-doc cache | `policy-doc-cache.sqlite3` | `policy_doc_cache` | `policy-doc-cache.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_POLICY_DOC_CACHE_DB` |
| Policy-verdict cache | `policy-verdict-cache.sqlite3` | `policy_verdict_cache` | `policy-verdict-cache.js` | `LOOPOVER_MINER_POLICY_VERDICT_CACHE_DB` |

The policy-doc and policy-verdict caches are the only stores above that hold no miner state of their own — both are
pure optimization, and deleting either file only forces the next run to redo the work it would have skipped. The
policy-doc cache caches the last-known ETag + body of each target repo's fetched policy docs
(AI-USAGE.md/CONTRIBUTING.md) so a repeated `discover` revalidates them with a conditional GET (`If-None-Match`)
instead of re-downloading static content, spending no extra rate-limit budget when GitHub answers
`304 Not Modified` (#4842). The policy-verdict cache goes one step further: once a repo's deciding doc's ETag is
confirmed unchanged, it reuses the already-resolved AI-usage-policy verdict instead of re-resolving it from the
(identical) doc text (#4843).

Every store resolves its file the same way: the store-specific env var above, else `LOOPOVER_MINER_CONFIG_DIR`,
else `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (falling back to `~/.config`), joined with `gittensory-miner/<file>`. Every store also opens
its file with `0700`/`0600` permissions and a shared `PRAGMA busy_timeout` so two instances on the same file
serialize writes instead of racing.

Opening a store through `local-store.js` also registers it with the CLI's crash-safety chokepoint
(`process-lifecycle.js`): the entrypoint calls `installCliSignalHandlers()` once at startup, so a `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`
mid-run — or an uncaught exception / unhandled rejection — closes every still-open ledger cleanly and exits with a
conventional code (130/143 for signals, non-zero for a crash) instead of dying mid-write. A store's normal `close()`
unregisters itself first, so the happy path never double-closes and a long-running `loop` never accumulates stale
handles. Cleanup only — no command business logic is affected. (#4826)

The "PR portfolio" `manage status` renders is currently a **read-time join**, not a dedicated table:
`collectManageStatus` reads `portfolio-queue.js` rows (via the `pr:{number}` identifier convention) and joins them
against `event-ledger.js`'s free-form `manage_pr_update` JSON events at query time, on every read. Decision: keep
this as a read-time join for now; revisit a dedicated indexed table only if/when PR-portfolio reads become frequent
enough (e.g. a live-polling dashboard) that the per-read linear event-ledger scan becomes a measured bottleneck.

### Laptop-mode quickstart

Zero-infra local install — no Docker, Redis, or Postgres required:

```sh
npm install -g @loopover/miner
gittensory-miner init
gittensory-miner doctor
gittensory-miner status
```

`init` creates `~/.config/gittensory-miner/` (or `LOOPOVER_MINER_CONFIG_DIR` / `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` overrides) and a local `laptop-state.sqlite3` bootstrap file. Re-running `init` is idempotent. Pass `--verify-token` to make one authenticated GitHub API call up front and fail fast if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is invalid or missing repository access scopes. `doctor` reports Node, the state directory, SQLite readiness, and whether Docker is installed (informational only). Every local store already applies its own pending schema migrations automatically the moment some other command first opens it, but `migrate` lets an operator proactively bring every EXISTING store file up to date in one pass (e.g. right after upgrading) instead of relying on whichever command happens to touch a given store first; a store file that hasn't been created yet is reported as skipped, not created.

First-time operators can instead run `gittensory-miner init --interactive` (#5176): a guided prompt for `GITHUB_TOKEN` (input hidden, never echoed or written to any log) and an optional coding-agent provider — plus that provider's model/timeout companion vars, each individually skippable with Enter — writes a starter `.env` to the state dir, then automatically reruns `doctor` against the collected values so setup problems surface immediately. `--interactive` makes no network calls of its own beyond what `doctor` already makes (none); non-interactive `init` invocations are unaffected.

From a local checkout:

```sh
npm install
npm --workspace @loopover/miner run build
npm link --workspace @loopover/miner
```

### Coding-agent driver configuration

The production driver is selected by `MINER_CODING_AGENT_PROVIDER`. The value is a comma-separated preference list:
the first configured name wins, unknown names are skipped, and an empty/unset list leaves production driver
construction fail-closed. See [`docs/coding-agent-driver.md`](docs/coding-agent-driver.md) for the interface-level
contract and provider behavior.

| Env var | Accepted values | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MINER_CODING_AGENT_PROVIDER` | `noop`, `claude-cli`, `codex-cli`, `agent-sdk` | Unset / empty means no provider is configured; the miner fails closed until a valid provider name is supplied. |
| `MINER_CODING_AGENT_CLAUDE_MODEL` | Any Claude model string accepted by the local `claude` CLI | Unset means `claude-cli` uses the CLI's own default model. Ignored by `noop`, `codex-cli`, and `agent-sdk`. |
| `MINER_CODING_AGENT_CODEX_MODEL` | Any Codex model string accepted by the local `codex` CLI | Unset means `codex-cli` uses the CLI's own default model. Ignored by `noop`, `claude-cli`, and `agent-sdk`. |
| `MINER_CODING_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | Positive integer milliseconds | Unset or invalid falls back to the CLI driver's default wall-clock timeout of `120000` ms. Ignored by `noop` and `agent-sdk`. |

### Recognizing a stale or missing coding-agent credential

When an attempt fails on a `claude-cli` / `codex-cli` provider, the CLI-subprocess driver folds the CLI's own output into a machine-readable `error` string on the attempt result. The credential/auth failure modes below map that exact string to a symptom and a concrete remediation — mirroring ORB's hosted-side [Recognizing a stale or missing credential](../../apps/gittensory-ui/src/routes/docs.self-hosting-ai-providers.tsx) table. Every string is emitted by [`cli-subprocess-driver.ts`](../gittensory-engine/src/miner/cli-subprocess-driver.ts); nothing here is speculative.

| Error string / pattern | Symptom | Remediation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude_code_error_<status>` | The `claude` CLI ran but its `--output-format json` envelope reported `is_error: true` (e.g. `claude_code_error_invalid_api_key`) — the OAuth token is missing, rejected, or expired. `gittensory-miner doctor` reports the same condition up front as `not authenticated: set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. | Regenerate a long-lived token with `claude setup-token` and set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, then retry. |
| `codex_no_auth` | `codex exec` exited non-zero with no structured error in its JSONL stdout and only the `Reading prompt from stdin...` banner on stderr — its `auth.json` credential is missing or expired. The driver appends its own remediation hint (`... auth.json missing or expired -- run codex auth to authenticate`). | Run `codex auth` to re-authenticate; the next attempt reads the refreshed `auth.json` with no further restart. |
| `<command>_exit_<code>` | Generic non-zero-exit fallback when neither structured parser matched (e.g. `codex_exit_1: ...`, `claude_exit_1: ...`). The driver appends the redacted stderr slice — an auth failure that neither parser recognized still surfaces here. | Read the appended detail; if it points at authentication, re-run `claude setup-token` or `codex auth` for the failing provider, otherwise address the reported error directly. |

## MCP server

The package ships a second bin entry, `gittensory-miner-mcp`, a minimal [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) stdio server that any MCP-compatible client can connect to:

```sh
gittensory-miner-mcp
```

It exposes these read-only tools:

- `gittensory_miner_ping` (#5153) — a health check returning a static `{ "status": "ok", "tool": "gittensory_miner_ping" }` object. Reads no AMS state, takes no arguments.
- `gittensory_miner_get_portfolio_dashboard` (#5155) — the per-repo portfolio-queue backlog dashboard: status counts (queued / in_progress / done), totals, and the oldest-queued age. Wraps `collectPortfolioDashboard()` (no new logic) — the same data `gittensory-miner queue dashboard --json` prints locally. Read-only, takes no arguments.
- `gittensory_miner_list_claims` (#5156) — lists the local claim ledger (repo, issue number, status, claimed-at, note) via `listClaims()`. Optional `repoFullName` / `status` filters pass through to the query. Read-only — exposes no claim/release mutation.
- `gittensory_miner_get_audit_feed` (#5158) — read-only, metadata-only event-ledger audit feed (`eventType`, `repoFullName`, `outcome`, `actor`, `detail`, `createdAt`). Wraps `collectEventLedgerAuditFeed()` with the same filters as `gittensory-miner ledger list` (`--repo`, `--since`, `--type`). Never returns `payload_json` or other raw ledger columns.

- `gittensory_miner_get_run_state` (#5160) — read-only per-repo run-state (`idle` / `discovering` / `planning` / `preparing`) via `getRunState` / `listRunStates`. Pass `repoFullName` for one repo (a null state means none recorded yet), or omit it to list all. The read-only analog of ORB's `gittensory_get_automation_state`; adds no state-set mutation.

- `gittensory_miner_list_plans` / `gittensory_miner_get_plan` (#5161) — read-only access to the persisted plan store (`planId`, plan DAG, status, `updatedAt`) via `listPlans` / `loadPlan`; `list_plans` takes an optional `status` filter, `get_plan` takes a `planId` and returns an explicit `{ planId, found: false }` for an unknown id. These read the store-backed AMS plan store — distinct from ORB's stateless `gittensory_plan_status` tool.

- `gittensory_miner_get_governor_decisions` (#5159) — read-only projection of the governor decision log (`id`, `ts`, `eventType`, `repoFullName`, `actionClass`, `decision`, `reason`), optionally filtered by `repoFullName`. The projection **excludes the sensitive `payload_json` column by construction** — `governor-ledger.js` reads it with an explicit named-column SELECT, never `SELECT *`.

- `gittensory_miner_status` (#5154) — read-only status + doctor diagnostics, returning `{ status, doctor }`: `status` = package/engine versions (and skew), node version, state-dir + config-file paths, and the resolved coding-agent driver (provider name, the model **env-var NAME** never its value, CLI-present boolean); `doctor` = the checks `gittensory-miner doctor` runs (Docker/CLI presence, config validity, …) as `{ name, ok, detail }`. Reuses `collectStatus` / `runDoctorChecks` so it can't drift from the CLI, and returns only names / booleans / paths — never any env-var value, token, or credential.

This completes the read-only AMS MCP tool surface (status, portfolio, claims, event-ledger, governor-ledger, run-state, plan-store).

### Client config

`gittensory-mcp` (ORB's hosted contributor-workflow tools) and `gittensory-miner-mcp` (AMS's own local state-visibility tools above) can run as two separate stdio servers in the same MCP client session — useful for a dual-role operator running both ORB and AMS on the same box. Generate ORB's half with `gittensory-mcp init-client --print claude` (see the [`@loopover/mcp` README](../gittensory-mcp/README.md#client-config)); `gittensory-miner-mcp` takes no flags, so its entry is just the bin name. Combined, a Claude Desktop / Claude Code style config looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gittensory": {
      "command": "gittensory-mcp",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    },
    "gittensory-miner": {
      "command": "gittensory-miner-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

`gittensory` exposes ORB's hosted contributor-workflow tools (issue ranking, PR packet prep, decision packs). `gittensory-miner` exposes AMS's own local state-visibility tools listed above (portfolio dashboard, claims, audit feed, run state, plans) — a fully separate, 100% local tool surface with no shared code or network calls between the two. Both follow the same `gittensory_*` tool-naming convention (`gittensory_...` vs. `gittensory_miner_...`), but back onto different stores: ORB's tools read the hosted gittensory backend, AMS's tools read this machine's own local SQLite files (see [Local storage](#local-storage)) — a handful of AMS tools even name the ORB tool they mirror (e.g. `gittensory_miner_get_run_state` is the read-only analog of `gittensory_get_automation_state`) so the relationship is explicit at the point of use, not just here.

## Version check

On every invocation the CLI starts an async npm registry lookup (5s timeout). When the installed package is behind `@loopover/miner@latest`, it prints a one-line upgrade command to stderr without blocking or failing the requested command. Set `GITTENSORY_NPM_REGISTRY_URL` to point at a mirror, same as `@loopover/mcp`.
