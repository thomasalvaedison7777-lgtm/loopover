// Coding-task-spec builder (#5132, Wave 3.5 follow-up). The second gap discovered alongside #5132's CLI
// wiring: `IterateLoopInput.title`/`instructions`/`acceptanceCriteriaPath` had no builder anywhere in this
// package. `packages/gittensory-engine/src/miner/acceptance-criteria.ts` already composes a PromptPacket +
// FeasibilityGateResult into an immutable AcceptanceCriteria document (and deliberately does NOT write it --
// "actually writing it into the attempt's worktree is the worktree primitive's job", per its own header) --
// this module is that caller: derives the four inputs from a real target issue + the already-fetched
// SelfReviewContext (#5145), then writes the file for real.
//
// issueStatus is intentionally left undefined when computing feasibility: buildIssueQualityReport (the only
// thing that could supply it) lives only in root src/signals/engine.ts and has never been extracted into
// @loopover/engine (same gap #5145's own header documents for `issueQuality`). This is not a
// fabrication -- feasibilityInputFromPreStartCheck's OWN documented default for a missing
// issueQualityStatus/lifecycle is "ready", the same honest-default precedent already established.
//
// Target-repo stack detection (#4786 / #4785 follow-up): `detectRepoStack` already returned a structured
// language/package-manager/command description, but nothing in the attempt path consumed it -- instructions
// were issue text + an acceptance-criteria path only. This module now appends that real stack summary (and
// any confidently-inferred validation commands) to the coding-agent prompt so the agent validates against
// THIS repository's tooling rather than assuming LoopOver/gittensory CI, Codecov, or `npm run test:ci`.
