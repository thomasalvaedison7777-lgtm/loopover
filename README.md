Gittensory is a deterministic control plane for Gittensor OSS contribution work.

It helps contributors plan cleaner work, helps maintainers review with less public noise, and keeps private scoring, wallet, hotkey, and reviewability context out of public GitHub output.

It is also the single converged home of the native review system; the legacy separate reviewbot repo/runtime is not part of the active architecture described here.

It is not a Gittensor explorer, public leaderboard, reward-farming bot, wallet dashboard, or autonomous PR agent.

## Privacy Boundary

Gittensory keeps sensitive context private by default.

- MCP local branch analysis sends metadata, not source contents.
- Public GitHub comments never include wallet, hotkey, reward estimate, private ranking, raw trust score, or reviewability context.
- Optional AI summaries receive compact deterministic signal bundles, not raw source code.
- Maintainer packets and scoring context stay on protected API/MCP surfaces.

See [Privacy and security](https://gittensory.aethereal.dev/docs/privacy-security) for the full boundary.

## Review Capabilities

Gittensory CI and gittensory review score, gate, and comment on pull requests. The review algorithm is open-source; operators tune behavior through per-repo settings and the `GITTENSORY_REVIEW_*` feature flags, every one of which ships **OFF** and is opt-in per repo.

- **Safety scan** — defangs untrusted PR title/body/diff (prompt-injection neutralization) before the AI reviewer reads them, and scans the diff for leaked secrets, surfacing a `secret_leak` blocker.
- **CI + full-file grounding** — grounds the AI reviewer with the PR's finished CI status and the full post-change content of the changed files, so claims are verified against reality instead of predicted.
- **Codebase RAG** — retrieval-augmented context that queries the codebase vector index for related callers, modules, and conventions and appends them to the reviewer prompt (additive only; inert until an index exists).
- **Submitter-reputation gating** — an internal-only spend control that downgrades new / burst / low-reputation submitters to a deterministic-only review, never surfaced on any public comment, label, or check.
- **Unified review comment** — renders the public PR feedback as one in-place comment instead of multiple panels. With `.gittensory.yml`'s `review.changed_files_summary` also on (off by default), it gains a deterministic, no-AI "Changed files" collapsible: one row per file category (source/test/docs/config/generated), with file counts and +/- totals.
- **Per-repo activation** — capabilities roll forward (and back) one flag and one repo at a time via the `GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPOS` allowlist.

**Check-run and comment surfaces, disambiguated** (a common point of confusion — these are three independent, separately-configured things, not layers of the same feature):

- **`Gittensory Orb Review Agent`** (`gate.*` / `settings.gateCheckMode` / `settings.reviewCheckMode`, off by default) — the authoritative GitHub Check Run carrying the gate's pass/fail verdict. This is the one worth making a required status check.
- **`Gittensory Context`** (`settings.checkRunMode` / `settings.checkRunDetailLevel`, off by default) — a separate, purely advisory Check Run. At its default `checkRunDetailLevel: minimal` it publishes no findings at all; even at `standard`/`deep` it only re-renders content already shown elsewhere. Never make this one required.
- **Inline review comments** (`GITTENSORY_REVIEW_INLINE_COMMENTS` + `.gittensory.yml`'s `review.inline_comments`, off by both by default) — real, reply-able line-anchored PR review comment threads (CodeRabbit-style). This is the ONLY one of the three that posts an interactive per-line thread; the two check runs above never do. With `.gittensory.yml`'s `review.suggestions` also on, a precise line-anchored fix is additionally rendered as a one-click, committable GitHub suggested-change block. With `review.finding_categories` also on (off by default), each finding is additionally tagged with a category — security/correctness/performance/maintainability/tests/style — in both the inline comment label and the unified comment's "Finding categories" collapsible; a deterministic path/keyword fallback covers whatever the model omits.
